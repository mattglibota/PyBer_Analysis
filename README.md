# PyBer Analysis
Analyzing Ride Info by City Type

## Summary Table

There are substaintially more urban rides than suburban and rural rides, but there are also more drivers competing for rides. Therefore there is the highest ride:driver ratio in rural, and lowest in urban. This trend is supported by rural drivers having the highest fare average, and urban having the lowest. It is further supported by rural rides having the highest average fare per ride, which is likely due to larger distances between destinations. On the contrary, urban riders have the lowest average fare per ride, which is likely due to shorter distances between destinations. Suburban rides sit in between urban and rural for all trends.

From an overall perspective, Urban rides make up a majority of Pyber's revenue.

## Time-Series Fares 

During the first 4 months of 2019, the total fare per week remains relatively consistent for all 3 city types: urban, suburban and rural. The total fare range for each city type is approximately $500 over the time frame analyzed. The charting continues to support urban cities being the highest revenue area. There are small peaks and valleys present in the data but there do not appear to be any attributable reasons for them. For example, it does not exhibit seasonality or shared trends across all city types)

## Implication

Urban city types continue to be the largest source of revenue for PyBer. There may be opportunity to capture more of the ride share market, as there appears to be underutilized drivers in the Urban cities. Rural city types are most lucrative for drivers on a per ride basis.
